# **App Name**: Realm Architect

## Core Features:

- World Map Display: Display the procedurally generated world map, allowing users to pan and zoom.
- Resource Management: Implement resource management mechanics. Resources should automatically deplete based on the scale of the structures present in the game.
- World Generation: Generate the initial world map using AI, populating terrain, resources and points of interest. The LLM will act as a tool for game masters to create expansive worlds with little manual labor.
- Construction Interface: Implement a construction/city building interface where the user may choose and place structures in their realm.
- Turn Resolution: Basic turn-based gameplay mechanics. An event system can periodically trigger in the world when the user advances the turn.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy tones, greens and browns, to reflect nature and construction.
- Secondary color: Light grays and beige for UI elements.
- Accent: Gold or bronze for highlighting important resources or actions.
- Clear and readable fonts for in-game text and menus.
- Simple, intuitive icons for resources, buildings, and actions.
- Clean and organized layout, easy to understand and navigate.
- Smooth and subtle animations for world events, resource gathering, and construction.
